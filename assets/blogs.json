Plan where you'll be camping each night as well as the section of trail you'll be hiking each day on a backpacking trip in case you need to be located for an evacuation. The best insurance is a written reminder with all of your information left behind with someone who isn't going and expects you to return or check in by a certain time.",

On your map, what appears to be a few hundred yards of scree that you can skip across in seconds may actually be a labyrinthine boulder field that will take you an hour or more to scramble your way through. And that thin, seemingly innocuous blue line cutting through your trail could turn out to be a raging torrent rather than the gentle stream you imagined. Given the foregoing, it's well worth spending a half-hour or so at the computer scanning recent trip reports for anything that could cause problems.",

You could also consider a self-standing tent. If you are unsure about the requirements, consulting will be extremely beneficial. It is critical to plan ahead of time for what you will require.
